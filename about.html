				the moonlight at night on the rooftop; I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind,I like to do thought experiments when I cannot sleep in the middle 
				of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and fog in winter.I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like villages,
